# PARISH-WEBPAGE-FRONT

**PARISH-WEBPAGE -** is a full-stack application that aims to present a simple parish website with the ability to edit certain things like intentions and announcements, in the style of a simple "Wordpress". The project consists of three repositories:

- [FRONTEND - CLIENT](https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-front)
- [BACKEND](https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-backend)
- [FRONTEND - ADMIN PANEL](https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-adminpannel)

### I RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THE REPOSITORY TO THE SAME FOLDER.

## CURRENTLY BROWSING THE FRONTEND REPOSITORY
**Frontend repository -** contains the source code of the client-side application, which communicates with the backend using the Axios library, allowing for HTTP requests to be made. The website contains interactive tables that allow for convenient display and browsing of data, making it less static.





## DEMO
**YOU CAN ALWAYS CHECK THE APPLICATION [HERE](https://yashino.usermd.net/).**

## HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE REPOSITORY
1. Clone the `PARISH-WEBPAGE-FRONT` repository to your computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-front.git
```
2. Open the terminal and go to the parish-webpage-front/ folder in the repository.
```bash
cd parish-webpage-front/
```
3. Install packages.
```bash

# ATTENTION !!!
## SOME OPTIONS WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THE APPLICATION REQUIRES A BACKEND FOR INTENTIONS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS
### YOU ALSO NEED TO CHANGE `.env.example` TO `.env` AND CONFIGURE THE BACKEND AND RUN IT
### IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS, I RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THE REPOSITORY TO THE SAME FOLDER.
